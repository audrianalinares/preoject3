This project I had to make a To Do list app where a user can add to dos and mark off completed to dos once done.
I used html, css, and javascript.
Overall this project was a bit difficult for me. I re-did it multiple times but i learned a lot from it.
In the future I would like to improve on everything over all and not try multiple times. I would also like to improve on javascript and also bootstrap.
